# **Introduction**

Scented candles is an e-commerce website I have created for my milestone 4 project. It allows users to view the business products, which include candles and wax melts, allowing them to securly purchase any of the products online. This in turn allows the business to advertise and showcase their products and helps to increase their revenue.
