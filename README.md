# **Introduction**

Scented candles is an e-commerce website I have created for my milestone 4 project. It allows users to view the business products, which include candles and wax melts, allowing them to securly purchase any of the products online. This in turn allows the business to advertise and showcase their products and helps to increase their revenue.

[Products](readme/wireframes/Products-page.png)
[Product Information](readme/wireframes/Product-details.png)
[Sign In / Register](readme/wireframes/SignIn_Register.png)
[Profile](readme/wireframes/Profile.png)
[Shopping Cart](readme/wireframes/Shopping-cart.png)
[Checkout](readme/wireframes/Checkout.png)
[Manage Products](readme/wireframes/Manage-products.png)

## **Design**

For the colors I used the palette below using purples for the main content and navbar and the green for the buttons to stand out. The colors blend well together and match the overall theme of colorful candles being sold

![Color Theme](readme/images/color-theme.PNG)

I used a hero image to cover the body of the pages and it can be seen on all pages for consistancy and relevancy

For the fonts I linked GoogleFonts into the pages, using Oswald for the main text and Gwendolyn for the Logo text to stand out, as they both look well together

# **Features**

## **Current Features** 

### **Registered And Non Registered Users**

- Navigation Bar
  - The website has a fixed navbar with clickable logo and website name which will take the user back to the homepage
  - There is a dropdown for all products, candles and wax melts with the ability to sort the products
  - There is a search bar for users to easily find a certain product

  - The navbar is responsive when on small devices with menu items being shown once the burger icon is clicked

- Responsive Layout
  - The layout is responsive on all different sized devices from mobiles to desktops, in order to make all content easily readable and for best aesthetics

- Buttons
  - All buttons were styled the same for a consistant look throughout the website
  - On hovering over any button the colors will be inverted to give visual feedback to the user

- Back To Top
  - I created a back to top button which shows once the user scrolls down through the products. This is in order for the user to easily navigate back to the top of the page if needed

- Shopping Cart
  - The shopping cart allows users to easily update or remove an item from their cart or go ahead and checkout

- Checkout Page
  - The checkout page allows users to enter their shipping details
  - Stripe is used to allow users to make a payment

- Footer
  - The footer which is fixed to the bottom of page includes the social media links for user to follow. These links use a hover effect for visual feedback and on clicking will open a new tab


### **Registered Users Only**

All registered users have all the above features with added:

- User Profile
  - On registering or logging in, a user can go to their profile to update shipping details or see past orders.
  - An added nav menu item of "Sign Out" is now visible to users logged in to easily logout.

### **Admin User**

Once logged in as an admin user all the above features are relevant plus:

- Manage Products
  - Once admin users are logged in they can add a product easily to a relevant category
  - On the product pade and individual product info pages the admin user can easily edit or delete a product
  - This now completes the basic CRUD functions of allowing a user to create, read, edit and delete products.

## **Future Features**

- Ratings and Reviews
  - I would love to add a rating system to each product with the ability for users to leave a review once they have purchased a product.

- Extra Add Functionality
  - I would like to add the functionality to admin users of adding new categories to the store.

- Toast Messages
  - Unfortunately I didn't have time to set up the toast messages to display to users. This is a feature I would like to add in order to give users visual feedback of their actions throughout the pages.

18. The ability to tell when successfully purchased a product
    - Once a user submits a purchase by checkout in the cart, they are shown the checkout success page which displays the order details

## **Testing Functionality**

- Testing was done on all the features of the website to make sure everything was workiong as expected.

- CRUD functions were tested to ensure products we easily created, read, updated and deleted as expected. 
- The checkout page was tested to make sure stripe was working to allow users to purchase products.

## **Bugs And Fixes**

![Pillow Error](readme/images/pillow-error.PNG)

- When Pillow was installed I found myself having to install it again once Gitpod was reopened even though it was saved in the requirments.txt file. After searching on slack I found the fix [here](https://lechien73.github.io/reqfix/) which explained it was a corrupted requirements.txt from the Gitpod template I had used. Once I saved the new requirements file it worked as expected.

- I came across a Page not found (404) error when I was testing the delete function on a product. As I came to learn, this product was in my basket and once deleted it still remained in the bag due to the browser cache. Once I cleared the browser data I was able to get the site working again.

![Value Error](readme/images/Value-error.PNG)

- I got a ValueError when trying to set up the adjust and remove views in the cart. After going over the code I realised I had product_id where it should have been item_id and also, as before, a clearance of the browser data and the cart worked as expected.
